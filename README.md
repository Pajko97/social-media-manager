# social-media-manager
Dashboard for managing multiple social media accounts at once. See all insights at one place.

Idealy, you don't want to check on 4 different platforms to gather data and see how well your brand is doing.

Initial version will include support for:

- Twitter API
- Instagram API
- TikTok API ( when they release it outside of USA )
- Facebook API

There is usage quotas on almost all of those, so number of calls to the respective API's will be limited
in some way.
